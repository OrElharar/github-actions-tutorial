The output "echo "Using secrets - example - ***"" is expected behavior when printing the secret value in a GitHub
Actions workflow.

When using secrets in GitHub Actions, the secret values are automatically masked in the workflow output to prevent
accidental exposure of sensitive information. This masking is done by replacing the actual secret value with *** when
printing it in the workflow logs, as seen in your example.

So, even though you might have set the environment variable EXAMPLE to a specific value using the secret, when you echo
or print it in the workflow, you'll only see ***, indicating that the actual value is masked and not visible in the
workflow logs.

This masking mechanism ensures that secrets are not inadvertently exposed and helps maintain a secure environment in
GitHub Actions workflows. Remember that secrets are intended to be used within the workflow's logic and are not
displayed in plain text in the workflow logs or to users without the appropriate access privileges.
