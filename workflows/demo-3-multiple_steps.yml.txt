In the provided YAML file, there are two jobs defined: "test" and "deploy," each with its set of steps.
The needs keyword is used to create a dependency relationship between the jobs, ensuring that the "deploy" job will
only run if the "test" job is successful.

Step Relations:

needs: test: This line in the "deploy" job specifies that the "deploy" job depends on the successful completion of
the "test" job. If the "test" job fails, the "deploy" job won't run. This ensures that code is only deployed if it
passes the tests.

Optional Step Relations:

Parallel Execution: In certain cases, you might have steps that can run independently of each other.
To execute steps in parallel, you can create multiple jobs and define them under the jobs key. GitHub Actions will
automatically run them in parallel when resources are available.

if Conditions: You can also conditionally execute steps based on specific conditions using the if keyword.
This allows you to customize the workflow based on certain criteria, such as the branch being pushed or the type of
event triggering the workflow.

These additional features give you the flexibility to create complex workflows that meet the specific requirements of
your project deployment process.
