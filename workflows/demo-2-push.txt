In the context of GitHub Actions, "actions" refer to reusable units of code that perform specific tasks within a
workflow. Actions are individual tasks that you can combine to create custom workflows.

They are stored in GitHub repositories and can be shared, reused, and extended by the GitHub community.

Actions can be used to automate various tasks such as building, testing, deploying, notifying, and more.
They are typically written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or shell scripts, allowing for flexibility and versatility in
what actions can accomplish.

Each action is designed to be self-contained and focused on a specific purpose, which makes them easy to integrate
and use within workflows. You can use pre-existing actions created by other developers or create your own custom actions
to suit your specific workflow needs.

Now, let's delve into the specific actions/checkout@v3 action mentioned in the provided YAML file:

The actions/checkout@v3 action is one of the official actions provided by GitHub. Its primary purpose is to fetch the
contents of a specified repository, making it available for use in subsequent steps of the workflow.
It clones the repository's code and files into the runner environment, allowing you to perform operations on the
codebase during the workflow execution.

The @v3 part of the action name indicates the version of the action to use. GitHub Actions is versioned, and different
versions might have variations or improvements in functionality.

When the workflow executes the actions/checkout@v3 action, it ensures that the latest version of the repository's code
is available to the rest of the workflow steps. This is crucial because actions in GitHub Actions operate in isolated
environments, and without checking out the code, subsequent steps wouldn't have access to the repository's files.

The actions/checkout@v3 action is one of the most commonly used actions in GitHub Actions workflows, as it is a
fundamental step to enable workflows to work with the repository's codebase effectively.

Overall, GitHub Actions, along with actions like actions/checkout@v3, provide a powerful and flexible automation
platform for building CI/CD pipelines and automating various development and deployment tasks.
