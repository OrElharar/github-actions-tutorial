This script demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow named "Events Demo 1." It defines a workflow with specific triggers
and branch patterns. When certain events occur, such as a pull request being opened, a workflow_dispatch event being
manually triggered, or a push to specific branches (main, dev-* branches, and feature/** branches),
the workflow will execute a job named "deploy" that performs several steps, including building and deploying a project.

Let's break down some parts of the script:

Branch Patterns:

branches:

main: The workflow is triggered only when there is a push event to the "main" branch.

'dev-*': The workflow is triggered when there is a push event to any branch that starts with "dev-"
(e.g., dev-1, dev-2, dev-3, etc.). The asterisk (*) acts as a wildcard, matching any characters after "dev-".

'feature/**': The workflow is triggered when there is a push event to any branch that starts with "feature/"
(e.g., feature/1, feature/2, feature/button/1, etc.). The double asterisk (**) matches any number of characters
after "feature/".

Paths to Ignore:

paths-ignore: This section specifies paths to ignore during the workflow run. In this case, the workflow will ignore
changes made to files in the .github/workflows/ directory. This prevents the workflow from being triggered recursively
if changes to the workflow files themselves are pushed to the repository.
