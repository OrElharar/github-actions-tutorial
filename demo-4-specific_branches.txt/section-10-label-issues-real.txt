## This workflow demonstrates how to use a custom action in a workflow.
## and the importance of providing Permissions.
## The permissions can be on the workflow level or on the job level.
## A good practice would be to use the permissions for the job level, on custom actions,
## hence this is an extra layer of security.
#
## The permissions would modify the GITHUB_TOKEN, which is used to authenticate the action.
## GITHUB_TOKEN is a special token that is automatically generated by GitHub,
## It is scoped to the repository that contains the workflow, has read/write permissions
## can be used to authenticate in a workflow run, and available only in the workflow run.
#
## The default permissions are read/write for most of the actions, but it can be changed.
## The permissions can be set to read, write, or none.
## To change the default behavior of the permissions in the whole repository,
## Go to GitHub repository settings -> Actions -> Permissions -> General -> Workflow permissions.
